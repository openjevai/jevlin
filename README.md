# Jevlin

[![Tip my tokens](https://tokentip.to/badge/copyleftdev.svg?logo=1)](https://tokentip.to/@copyleftdev)

A typed Zig SDK for TypeSafe AI's Jev. Ask yes/no, classification, and scoring
questions in one request. Get probabilities and Zig enums back.

**Zig 0.16.0 · Experimental · Independent of TypeSafe AI**

**OpenJEV support:** Jev is built by [TypeSafe](https://typesafe.ai). This fork keeps TypeSafe as the default and adds optional support for [OpenJEV](https://openjev.sh), a free community gateway to the same Jev model — set `OPENJEV_API_KEY` (or `JEV_PROVIDER=openjev`) to use it. Original project: https://github.com/copyleftdev/jevlin by @copyleftdev.

```zig
const Team = enum { billing, technical, sales };
const questions = .{
    .urgent = jevlin.noul("Does this need urgent attention?"),
    .team = jevlin.choice(Team, "Which team should handle this?", .{}),
    .severity = jevlin.score("How severe?", [3][]const u8{
        "Minor", "Workaround available", "Cannot use the service",
    }),
};
const result = try client.evaluate(
    .{ .ticket = "I was charged twice." }, questions, "jev-latest",
    workspace, &diagnostics,
);
// result.answers.team.choice is a Team.
```

The [complete example](examples/triage.zig) shows client setup, buffers, and cleanup.
[Offline examples](examples/README.md) cover structured questions, error handling,
and bounded parallel use.

## Use it

For a local checkout, add this to your `build.zig.zon` dependencies:

```zig
.jevlin = .{ .path = "../jevlin" },
```

In `build.zig`, add the dependency to your application module:

```zig
const jevlin = b.dependency("jevlin", .{ .target = target, .optimize = optimize });
exe.root_module.addImport("jevlin", jevlin.module("jevlin"));
```

You own the request, response, and scratch buffers. Results borrow that memory;
copy borrowed data before reusing it. Give each concurrent worker its own client
and workspace. HTTP/TLS uses the allocator you supply.

## Run the checks

```sh
zig build check
zig build check -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe
zig build examples
```

Checks run locally without API credentials. Transport tests use loopback sockets.
Native CI covers Linux, macOS, and Windows in both modes, including TLS rejection
and allocation recovery. Separate manual workflows run
[coverage-guided fuzzing](.github/workflows/fuzz.yml) and
[soak tests](.github/workflows/soak.yml).

With `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` set, `zig build live` sends a real request. It is billable,
and retries can incur additional charges. The SDK does not read credential files.

To use OpenJEV instead, set `OPENJEV_API_KEY` (or `JEV_PROVIDER=openjev` with the
key). The endpoint and model switch automatically; no TypeSafe key is required.
OpenJEV is a free community gateway to the same Jev model.
